## Overview

A simple ray tracer written in Rust. Translated from [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) into Rust (from C++).

I also recorded myself building this, so check out the - [Rust: Building a Ray Tracer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hD0gxRzzg&list=PLctja8lh-0MdlbFXjmBoFn_1hiK4qkVqe) playlist on YouTube.

For reference, a high-resolution render of the final scene looks like this:

Enjoy! :)
