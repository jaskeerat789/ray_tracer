## Overview

A simple ray tracer written in Rust. Translated from [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) into Rust (from C++).

If you want to watch the YouTube series where I code this solution "live", have a look at the [Rust: Building a Ray Tracer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5hD0gxRzzg&list=PLctja8lh-0MdlbFXjmBoFn_1hiK4qkVqe) playlist.

A high-resolution render looks like this :)
